# Enemy AI Behavior Tree 

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/J7RnUc4g9Pk) you can see a full, end to end implementation of an enemy AI with 4 attacks using a Behavior Tree framework, [AI Tree](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/ai-tree-229578?aid=1101l9QvC).

As of the Navigation Components 1.1.3, `NavMesh.CalculateTriangulation()` does not properly generate `NavMeshTriangulation.areas` per Navigation Area. Showing navigation areas therefore **only works if you build using the legacy system**, which does not support different navigation meshes per NavMeshAgent type.

## Quickstart
This repo uses [AI Tree](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/ai-tree-229578?aid=1101l9QvC) as the Behavior Tree framework. Since this is a paid asset it cannot be included. It also uses a [Quirky Llama](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/llama-quirky-series-178234?aid=1101l9QvC) model which is less important, but the animation names that are played will need to be updated to whatever animations you choose to use.
If you do not own at least AI Tree, you will have to reconstruct the Behavior Tree and modify the code to match with your behavior tree framework of choice.

1. Import AI Tree and Quirky Llama (or replace llama with your 3d model)
2. Import [Unity Particle Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/particle-pack-127325?aid=1101l9QvC) (free)
3. Click play!

The package manifest includes Navigation Components already.
